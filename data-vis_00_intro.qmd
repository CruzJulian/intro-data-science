# What is this

This is a notebook for the use in a data visualization course.

I dont have structured it yet. But I can link here some of the chapters.

Here I will explain some things about visualizationa from my understanding. this work has a lot of opportunities for growing, be kind to inform mistakes and collaborate in the way you want.
